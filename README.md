# tkd-emailer
Desktop application commissioned by TaeKwonDo studio to replace the email functionality in a legacy version of MAS' martial arts studio management software.

Allows for searching and sorting of people in the underlying MAS Access database, and then uses Outlook to send emails composed in the tkd-emailer to the selected recipients.
